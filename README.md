## Instructions
+ Verify that Node.js is installed. If you see anything when you run `which npm` in a terminal, it is. If not, follow the instructions at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install.
1. Install the packages from package.json: `npm install`
2. Install live-server package globally (-g): `npm install -g live-server`
3. Run `npm start` to start live server

When you save `main.scss` (/sass/main.scss), a file named `style.css` will be created in /css.
