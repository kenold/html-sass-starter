## Instructions
You need to install Node JS to run `npm` commands. So, verify that Node.js is installed first. To check if Node JS is installed on your computer, run `which npm` in a terminal. If you see a `/nodejs/npm` path, you have Node JS - if not, follow the instructions at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install.

1. Install the packages from package.json: `npm install`
2. Install live-server package globally (-g): `npm install -g live-server`
3. Run `npm start` to start live server

When you save `main.scss` (/sass/main.scss), a file named `style.css` will be created in /css.
